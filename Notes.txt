Mounting and Unmounting ==> Agar koi component is screen pe appear ho raha hai use
                            bolte hain mounting.

                            Whereas agar koi component screen se remove hota hai, use bolte hain unmounting.


<================================ UseEffect { cleanUp } ==================================>

    UseEffect(()=>{ ==> This works like component will unmount
        console.log("1");

        return ()=>{      // ==> This is called the cleanUp function.
            console.log("2");
        }
    },[])


    So whenever a function inside useEffect returns a function, it is called the cleanUp function.
    This function works before the component is going to be unmounted.


Important Note :-  So this works like Component will Unmount. 


useEffect(()=>{ ==> This works like Component Did Mount
    console.log("1");
}, []);


<------------------------------- 2nd case ------------------------------------------------>

 ==>   Now if there is no dependency array,

    useEffect(()=>{
        console.log("1");

        return ()==>{
            console.log("2");
        }
    })

    So this works after every re-render since there is no dependency array.
    So cleanUp function will be called everytime before the re-render.

    So the output will be
        1  ==> For the first render
        2  ==> Just before the 2nd render, the cleanUp function will be called.
        1  ==> This will be of the 2nd render and the cycle will go on.
        2
        1
        .
        .
        .
        .

<=========================== Subscription ====================================>

If you have created a subscription ( Talking realtime with the database like onSnapshot, onAuthStateChanged ) on a component and if you unmount the same component, so we should
unsubscribe before unmounting the component. Otherwise React says that there can be probably a memory leak.
